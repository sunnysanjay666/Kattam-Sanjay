💻 Projects That Define Me

Project 1 : life under water - /September - December/ 2022
* A project utilizing AI to clean water involves deploying intelligent robots to monitor and remove pollutants from underwater environments.
* The system uses sensors to analyze data in real-time to optimize cleaning processes.
* Ensuring efficient and effective removal of contaminants, thereby preserving aquatic ecosystems and promoting marine health.

Project 2 : Under Water Waste Detection - /January - March/ 2023
* This project focuses on improving the accuracy of YOLOv8 model for detecting underwater waste by enhancing image quality and refining object detection techniques.   
* Given the challenges of underwater environments—such as poor lighting, low contrast, and distortion.
* The project incorporates the Dark Channel Prior Algorithm to enhance image clarity before detection. 
* The YOLOv8 model has been trained and validated on an underwater dataset to detect various waste objects.

Project 3 : Games recommendation system - /August - November/ 2023  
* Game suggestions based on user preferences and history. 
* Enhancing experience and boosting engagement and sales.
  
Project 4 : Accident Detection System - /December - February/ 2023-2024 
* Developed an automatic accident detection system using accelerometer data to identify potential vehicle collision
* Designed an algorithm to interpret accelerometer readings and differentiate between normal movements and sudden, high-impact events indicative of accidents.

Project 5 : Agri-Drone Technology - /March / 2024 (Present)
* Developed an autonomous precision spraying drone using GPS and AI-driven path planning to optimize efficient and reduce chemical waste.
* integrated machine learning and IoT for real time crop health detection, adaptive spraying, and remote monitoring.
* Implemented LIDAR based obstacle avoidance and energy - efficient battery management for extended autonomous operation.
